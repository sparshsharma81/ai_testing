 D60 chart is a shastiamsha divisional chart of very big 60 divisional of a sign. So one can think fraction of thirteen it is so deep. Here so many secrets can be revealed by D60 . We get to know how we will get.

Shastiamsha is a past life we see the past life karma that the person is having any curse or not , also we can see clue for present life from it, what the person life will be. Also it is a sanchit karma what is to be faced in the life, during the journey of a life what a native has to be faced. So everything is covered in d60. Past life deeds whether the curse or blessing , clue for present life what you do so that easy you get in this life as well as what is to be faced in the life that is a sanchit karma. These 3 things has to be seen.

The twins chart here in this d60 chart gets seperated even though they are born in difference 30 sec, 1 minute this chart gets seperated and because of this difference both the life gets difference. So the twins chart can be identified clearly by this chart difference by 2 minutes as ascendent changes diety changes. Every d60 ascendent in d60 has one deity goddess, god so accordingly it runs. D60 represents yourself and how the past life has affected this life. It says that d60 lagna represents so many things. D60 lagna represent yourself and how is your past life affects this life.

• D60 shows the karma from bhava where the planet or planets afflicted or conjucted or aspected. • It shows the karma from bhava where the planets are afflicted or conjuncted or aspected. How many planets are afflicted or how many other aspects are there that denotes this. • If D60 beneficial planet should be aspected by malefic planet and more than the 2 planets malefic aspecting balancing planets. So its like how it is been placed it shows the curse. • If benefic planet of d60 should be aspect by malefic planet in your d60 chart thats only aspect allowed. • If more than 2 malefic planets are aspecting benefic planet then you have a curse. Either the ascendent lord of your ascendent or ascendent lord of your D60.

D40 is a maternal curse getting curse from maternal family, mother family. D45 is the paternal curse from the ancestor of parents father, father line you might be getting any curse. D60 means your own curse, you accumulated such a deeds because of which you are getting curse so its your own deeds. D60 also shows the traits in this life. Past loves karma and manifest in D60. It can be manifest in D60 .

How the past life karma is there?

Past life can be seen from the arudha lagna in d60 . You can take the arudha lagna as lagna in d60 from that arudha lagna you can see past life of that person. Mula dasha is also calculated according to this. Mula dasha is very powerful dasha it is to be shown in D60 chart. Especially who are interested in past life deeds they must see the mula dasha. Mula dasha is also some kind of planetary position where the person can see his past life deeds and accordingly interepretation one can be seen that how what kind of a things person has been done. D60 can also connect to dharma what kind of religious beliefs do you have is also to be seen. We all know that 9th house is a dharma house. So we should see 9th lord of d1 chart is places in which amsha in d60 chart. That means that bad karma is the cause of your birth in this life. Because of that reason you have taken birth.

• The first house in d60 chart , ascendent lord of D60 chart , planets placed in first house of d60 chart and planet aspecting in first house of d60, that deity of d60 decides your past karma. This is also one theory of seeing past karma. • If there is no planet in D60 ascendent, no planet is also not aspecting it, then life will be free from any encumbrance of past life so you are not suffering because of past life. You are not influence of past life deeds. • If the first house lord or ascendent lord of D60 is malefic like sun, mars , saturn it is malefic. If your ascendent lord of D60 is jupiter, venus , moon, mercury that means your life is smooth • If you are born in sun , mars , saturn ascendent lord in D60 chart that means you are going to have a slow growth in your life and always cause a delay, because of your certain deeds in past life. Because of your own deeds of past life you are not able to get that good peace , good speed in this life. • If your ascendent lord in D60 chart is jupiter, mercury , moon and venus then this life will be smooth.

Now first house lord placed in which house in D60 chart? • If your ascendent lord of d60 placed in 1 or 5 or 9 houses trikona houses it means you are devotee and because of good devotion you got this life. • If your ascendent lord of d60 is placed in 2, 6 and 10 houses you are materialistic, you are born because of material pleasures to enjoy. • If your ascendent lord of d60 is placed in 3, 7 and 11 house then your life is ariticial life, illusory life. You know all the film stars or many people living artificial life. May be people get inspired by you but you yourself beleive in your living as artificial life. • If your ascendent lord if d60 is placed in 4th , 8th or 12th house then you are a moksha karaka, you're taken last birth in this life then after you will be having a moksha. • Then you have to see the 9th house . If 9th house of your D60 is damaged that means there is a struggle in this life. And not blessed by anyone and this life will be very very tough for you. • 6 , 8 and 12 houses are also very important in D60 chart. You have to see those 6 , 8 , 12 houses which planets place and who are their lords with which they associated with them they creates misfortune. So you have to see lords of 6th, 8th ,12th houses which planets they are, which planet is seated in these houses, and which planets they are conjuncted with. `,

`Key Points: 1. Concept of Hora: a. Weekdays, Sunday (Su), Monday (Mo), Tuesday (Ma), Wednesday (Me), Thursday (Ju), Friday (Ve), Saturday (Sa). b. What is the logic behind this order? ->HORA is the reason, there are 24 horas. First hora of the day starts at sunrise. 2. Brahma Gayatri (sunrise), Vishnu’s or Achyuta’s time (noon), Siva gayatri (sunset), Kali gayatri (not auspicious). 3. Distance from sun, speed w.r.t. to earth, the rule used for allocating houses to planets. (Sa is slowest). 4. Hindus consider 1day starting from one Sunrise to the next. 5. Astronomical fact is, Sa is slowest (takes 2.5yrs to move one sign, or 30yrs), Ju (takes 1yrs to move one rasi OR 12 yrs), Ma (1.5yrs), Su (1yr), Ve and Me and Mo - This is the order. 6. For Saturday, the horas starting with Sa will be Sa, Ju, Ma, Su, Ve, Me. Mo. This makes one cycle of 7 hours, so for one day (of 24hrs or horas), there will be three cycles followed by (24-21=3 horas of) Sa, Ju, Ma - Next day begins with Sun's HORA (Hence, the day after Saturday is Sunday) and so and so forth. 7. This is what Narasimha knows about an explanation for a Day consisting 24horas -> 12 rasis - one for day and one for night, hence, there are 24 hours. HORA is taken from AHORATRA, AHO is Day, and RATRA is night. 8. Four houses are considered base of Purusharthas. 1, 10, 7 and 4 are bases of the DHARMA, ARTHA, KAMA and MOKSHA purusharthas. 9. DIGBALA - how close a planet is close to the base? (one of the strengths relate to a planet). 10. Me and Ju are planets of dharma, Sa is planet of Kama, Su and Ma are planets of Artha and Mo and Ve are planets of Moksha depending on how far away they are to a base, they are accordingly given strength. This planet association is used to compute “shadbalas” other strengths, which will be detailed in future classes. 11. Civil Calendar is Sun’s calendar. 12. Indian Solar calendar: Su enters Aries, MESHA masa. Su enters Vrishaba, vrishabha masa. Original Solar calendar, each month has 30 days.

13. Solar Motion and Solar Days

When the Sun moves from 0° to 1°, one solar day is complete.

When the Sun is between 1° and 2°, it is the second solar day, and so on.

14. Length of the Year

The ancient system counts 30 days × 12 months = 360 days in a year.

15. Original Solar Calendar vs Civil Calendar

The Sun’s motion is variable; sometimes a day can appear as:

29 days

30 days

27 hours

29 hours

This variability is acceptable in a solar astronomical calendar but not possible in the civil calendar.

Civil calendars use sunrise as a reference, while some traditional systems use the Sun’s position at noon.

Hence different calendars get mixed, making the system a convention, not a strict scientific measurement.

16. Solar Position Differences

If you compare today’s noon Sun position with the same day, same time next year, the Sun will not be in the same position.

17. Rāśi Degree Meaning

If someone says "4th day of Meṣa māsa," it means:

The Sun is in the 4th degree of Aries (Meṣa).

This is a scientific, degree-based definition.

18. Beginning of the Zodiac

When the Sun enters Meṣa (Aries) → called Meṣa Saṅkramaṇa.

Aries is the beginning of the zodiac.

19. The Four Movable Signs and Yugas

The 4 movable signs:

Aries

Cancer

Libra

Capricorn

They are associated with the four Yugas:

Krita

Treta

Dvāpara

Kali

Kali Yuga is signified by Capricorn (Makara):

Ruled by Saturn (a Tamasik sign)

Mars is exalted here → associated with aggression and dynamism.

20. Importance of Makara Saṅkranti

When the Sun enters Makara, it is celebrated as Pongal / Makara Saṅkranti (around January 14).

Some astrologers cast a chart at this time to predict the entire year.

Others cast a chart when the Sun enters Aries.

No calendar is perfect—different charts are used for different purposes.

21. Multiple Calendars

There are 10–15 different calendars, each serving a specific purpose.

22. Ardra Praveśa Chart

When the Sun enters Ārdrā Nakshatra (in Gemini), some create a chart to predict rainfall for the coming year.

23. Nakshatra Division

There are 27 Nakshatras, covering 360° equally.

Lunar Calendar Concepts 24. Various Lunar Calendars

Multiple forms of lunar calendars exist.

25–27. Sun, Moon, Mind, Soul Analogy

Sun (Su) = Soul (Ātman)

Moon (Mo) = Mind (Manas)

Jupiter (Ju) = Intellect (Buddhi)

Soul cannot be directly perceived — the mind is the agent through which we interact with the soul.

Just as you cannot stare at the Sun, you cannot directly interact with the soul.

28–29. Importance of Sun and Moon

Both Sun and Moon are important.

Lunar calendars are soli-lunar (based on both Sun and Moon).

30–31. Amāvasyā and Lunar Motion

When Sun and Moon are exactly together (same longitude) → Amāvasyā.

The Moon completes one full zodiac cycle while the Sun moves one sign; the Moon periodically catches up to the Sun.

32. Lunar Calendar Mechanics

Lunar days are based on relative displacement of the Moon from the Sun:

Moon’s longitude – Sun’s longitude (0°–359°).

Divide 360° into 30 equal parts → each = 12° → one lunar day (tithi).

Examples:

Moon 12° ahead of Sun → 1st lunar day.

Moon 24° ahead of Sun → 2nd lunar day.

Moon 348° ahead → 30th lunar day (end of month).

Each lunar day (tithi) has a name.

33–35. Pakshas and Key Days

Lunar days divided into:

Śukla Paksha – Moon waxing

Kṛṣṇa Paksha – Moon waning

Amāvasyā → time of Kali Mā; removes ignorance.

Pūrṇimā → day of truth (Satya Nārāyaṇa).

36. Naming of Lunar Months

Two types of lunar months:

Amānta – month starts after Amāvasyā (popular in Karnataka, Andhra).

Śuklanta – month starts after Pūrṇimā.

Amāvasyā ends when the Sun and Moon are exactly at the same degree.

Śuklanta months end when Sun and Moon are exactly opposite.

Amānta → good for mundane matters.

Śuklanta → important for spiritual matters.

37. Names of Lunar Months

Starting from when Sun & Moon are in Meena (Pisces):

Chaitra

Vaiśākha

Jyeṣṭha

Āṣāḍha

Śrāvaṇa

Bhādrapada

Kārtika

Mārgaśira

Puṣya

Māgha

Phālguna

38. Why These Names? (Nakshatra Basis)

Names are derived from Nakshatras:

Viśākhā lies on the border of Tula–Vṛścika.

Jyeṣṭhā lies on the Vṛścika–Dhanu border.

The month is named after the Nakshatra exactly opposite (180°) to the Sun at full moon (Śuklanta system).

People originally used Śuklanta and later shifted to Amānta, but kept the month names. `Key Points: Mantra Sastra: 1. Krishna is not only a significator for marriage and he is also for Learning. “Kleem krishnaya namah” – Krishna sits in 9th house of Guru. 2. Siva and Parvati are the natural karakas for marriage – when they are in the 7th house they can give marriage. Ex: “Namah Sivayai cha Nama Sivaya” 11 letters, 3 words – Siva and Parvati in 7th house bless the marriage. These are very effective, but are not from a particular Veda. 3. For specific Mantras from Vedas, it is a good idea to pray to the Guru who gave that Mantra or to the Rishi of that mantra before reciting them. Ex. Vishwamitra is the Rishi for Rigveda mantra “Vrishabam Charsha….” Chart Analysis: 4. Each house signifies several matters –relevant house for that matter is seen from that house in the corresponding divisional chart. Ex 4th house stands for several things like mother, education, comfort, heart, real estate etc, so for education see 4th house in D-24, for mother see 4th house in D-12 etc. 4th in Rasi chart shows heart. 5. In any chart note the following in that order in seeing charts a. First find the divisional chart that we want to see. b. Then see the house that we are interested in. For ex. to see the learning of Jyotisha, see 8th house in D-24. 4th shows general education. c. Who owns (lord of) that house? The planet is the boss for that aspect. This planet can set the rules for that house.

Lesson #7

3. Who occupies it? The occupants have control of that house and exert what is done. 4. What are the aspects on it – Rasi drishti (permanent influence), graha drishti (desire of the planet during a particular dasha, temporary influence), argala – forced intervention (virodhargala – breaks argala).

6. The following are the basic nature of each planet: a. Sa – work hard, very traditional, doesn’t like change etc. b. Ra – cheating, deceit, sudden reversals c. Ke – dhooma ketu – burn everything d. Ma – aggression, does not want to wait e. Sun – authoritative, king f. Moon – no enemies, comfort, sweet, Satwik happiness g. Jupiter – wisdom, Vedic knowledge… Jupiter aspect is very desirable h. Venus – excitement and pleasure – Rajasik happiness i. Mercury – analytical ability, learning

7. Ra, Sa in 4th house shows unhappiness. Unhappy with what is seen from the 4th house in the corresponding divisional chart. For example, the why can be seen from education in D-24, from mother in D-12.

8. In physical chart (D-1) and in Dasamsa (D-10), Ra and Ke are always opposite. In D-20, D-24 they are always together. They work together anyway. While Ra and Ke being together, consider both of them: consider Ra for bhoga and Ke for Moksha.

9. Occult learning – hidden knowledge – see 8th house in D-24 (house of hiding and tapasya). For example, Jyotisha doesn’t just come by reading a book; 8th house strength is needed to make it fruitful.

10. Guru Purnima or Vyasa Purnima – most times, in natural zodiac Sun is in Ge, Moon will be in Sg (9th house is the ...)

1. Lord of a house is like group leader. Rasi drishti – permanent influence. Graha drishti – desire to influence. Argala – intervention, decisive role (will always happen). Graha drishti and argala are during their dasha periods.

2. Karaka is like a project manager. Example: 4th house lord is the karaka for the project called mother. For a planet to give its result, it depends on its relation with karaka and the owner (significator) of that house. Karaka examples: Learning – Mercury; Astrology – Jupiter; Mother – Moon; Father – Sun.

1. Actual houses are the potential of a person. They are inanimate. The grahas are animate and represent kinetic energy and show the application of the potential of the person, which reflects as a tangible thing that can be seen by the Arudha.

2. Analogy: The house being the object, the lord of the house being the mirror, and the Arudha being the reflection of the object through the mirror.

3. Arudha of a house is at the same distance from the lord of that house as the lord of the house is from the corresponding house.

4. Lagna (Asc) is the seed of one’s existence. For example, when Moon is in Lagna with A11 and A5, then during Moon dasha/Antardasha, there will be gains due to A11 and recognition of abilities due to A5, and there will be a new beginning since it’s in Lagna.

5. Arudha Padas are not real; real aspects are from original house which we can’t see. Arudhas are the tangible reflections and illusions – Maya. These are important since we live in Maya. Also, Moon shows Parvati/Devi who stand for Maya.

6. AL is the Arudha of Lagna and it shows the image of one’s self. It is not to be considered artificial as the true self projects this image itself.

7. Houses from AL show the perceived image in people’s mind.

8. Mahadasha level is ruled by Sun. This period captures more stable things; Sun representing Satya and self will rule. Hence Sun is important at this level.

9. At Antardasha level and for Arudhas, Moon is important. Antardashas are ruled by Moon. Chandra lagna (Moon as Lagna) is also important as it shows the mind.

10. Moon is significator/karaka for Arudhas.

11. 8th house stands for sudden changes, working hard and occult knowledge.

12. Enemies are tangible obstacles represented by A6. If the planet of interest is in 12th from A6, it means giving up of enemies – less opposition. If so in D-24, it means less opposition in examinations etc.

13. 9th house shows Guru and Dharma. Saturn shows traditional knowledge.

14. Saturn is slow moving (manda).

15. 3,6,11 are very auspicious for any malefic planets – Sun, Mars, Saturn, Ra, Ke.

16. Saturn is karaka for masses, following, popularity etc. Saturn is karaka for 12th house; if occupying/aspecting 12th house, he makes the person give a lot but slowly. In 3rd house: shows lack of initiative but once started he completes it. Saturn and Mars are extremes; if they influence 3rd house, results mixed.

17. Argala is conclusive intervention.

18. Quadrants are Vishnu sthanas (effort). Trines are Lakshmi sthanas (blessings).

19. Ra shows engineering / research. Mercury shows analytical ability, math, journalism.

20. 10th house shows karma sthana. D-20 shows religious activities and spiritual growth. 5th house shows abilities. Ability for spiritual growth is bhakti and devotion.

21. In general: nth house from Lagna shows real aspects. A_n shows tangible aspects. nth from AL shows perceived image.

22. Exalted planets = excited, good fortune. Debilitated = unhappy, gives results only through hard work.

23. In D-20, debilitated planet is very strong – shows patience and submission. Example: Venus debilitated shows submission to Lakshmi.

24. 5th house shows abilities; A5 indicates tangible aspects. If link between these in D-20 → mantras + rituals performed are directly linked to bhakti and devotion.

25. In D-20: Jupiter karaka for mantra. Example given: Ju in Li, Ve in Vi, A5 in Sg → possibility of starting new mantra in Jupiter dasha/antar.

26. In D-24 during Ju phase: Ju in Pi (10th), debilitated, with A7 and A8 → interactions (A7) and 8th house aspects (A8). In Jupiter antar → meet Jupiterian people, occult/education changes etc.

27. D-10: A8 during a dasha may mean break in service.

28. A8 = mrityu pada.

29. Up to 6 levels of dasha can be used but only with accurate time.

30. Antardashas → pay attention to Arudhas. Planet occupying Arudha or giving argala will give results in its antardasha.

31. Yakshas are higher beings; if in Yakshamsa, period will shine magically.

40. LL = most auspicious planet.

41. 6th lord in ASC = obstacles on head. In D-9 → unavoidable obstacles in relations.

42. Before any chart, check ASC change moments.

43. In D-9, if 7th house is maraka, do not treat it as maraka.

44. For divorce → see 8th house (2nd from 7th). 6th for fights. A7 is tangible relationship.

45. 8th lord + 9th lord together: dharma affected.

46. Saturn = hard work, pain. UL (A12) = marriage. 3rd, 7th, 11th important.

47. Ke worst enemy of Sun; in 6th weakens Sun.

48. Look at 4th and 7th lords for marital comforts.

49. First marriage = 7th; second = 8th from 7th; break = 2nd from that.

50. D-9 rulers: Manushya, Deva, Rakshasa.

51. 2,6,10 artha trikona important for career.

52. Varuna amsa – west, foreign; Sheetala – cool; Ardra – auspicious; Brahma – downward; Ananta – upward.

53. nth from AL = perception.

54. If A10 in Scorpio → secretive work environment.

Spouse Section: Take Cancer as ASC for spouse (7th lord). 9th+10th lord conjunction = dharma-karma-adhipati yoga. Mercury in 3rd = authorship/writing. Do NOT use Arudhas for spouse; Arudhas only for native.

D-10: ASC in Virgo with Mercury → intelligent. 9th with Jupiter → strong dharma. 10th with Venus (9th lord) and Rahu (6th lord), AL → Rahu creates enemies, AL with Rahu → demonic image. 7th from ASC = desire; A7 = interaction; 7th from AL = fights. 3rd lord Ke in 4th, 7th from AL afflicting Moon → "burning things" during Moon dasha.

Rule: strong 6th → service; strong 7th → business.

Sun (12th lord) in 8th → vipareeta raja yoga.

D-40 maternal karma; D-45 paternal karma.

D-12: Mother: 4th lord. 8th lord debilitated = good. Jayayoga: strong LL, exalted 10th lord, debilitated 6th lord. Mars+Saturn together avoidable combination.

Father: 9th lord Mercury in Aquarius → philosopher. Jupiter+Venus aspecting Mercury = non-aggressive father.

Rasi meanings: Cn – compassionate; Ta – aggression; Vi – analytic; Ge – communication; Pi – spiritual; Sg – dharma.

If 4th and 9th lords in trines/ quadrants: good relation. 2-12 or 6-8 = bad.

Grandfather: In D-12 9th from 4th = maternal grandfather. 4th from 4th = maternal grandmother.

D-3: For younger sibling count forward; older backward. If ASC odd → forward; even → backward.

D-7: 5th from ASC first child; 3rd from that second etc. Odd → forward; even → backward. Exception signs: Ge,Cn,Aq,Pi reversed genders. Planets show gender: Su/Ma/Ju/Ra = male; Ve/Mo/Ke = female; Sa/Me = dual. Exalted = male; debilitated = female.

Child ASC: take lord's placement.

If the y m o v e a p art the raja y o g a will not ha p p en. 11. In case of Su, M a – If M a is a d v ance d, Su tra v els faster than M a and catches up with M a and hence it will function in the ne ar future. 12. M o and R a in L a. A S C is at 2 5o , R a at 10 o and M o at 7o . In mund ane charts M o sho ws m asses (mind of the m asses). 13. R a causes eclipse to M o. R a alw a ys m o v es b ackw ards. When M o is g oing to catch up with R a in the sa m e sign of L A, this eclipse and hence a setb ack in the v ery house of e xistence, it sho ws loss of p o pularity of his candid acy. But, since R a m o ving b ackw ards is m o ving a w a y fro m A S C and M o g etting close to L esso n # 21 91 A S C m e ans that after a larg e setb ack, M o with A S C will g et the sup p ort of the m asses b ack to him. 14.

With M e, it giv es Budha-A dity a y o g a (also calle d Vipuna Y o g a) – the result is that the p erson is v ery intellig ent. N ot to o close, if to o close, M e g ets co m bust. There are different o pinions on this. N arasimhaji’s o pinion is, this y o g a giv es result when the y are v ery close. M e is the le arning a bility and Su b eing the S oul, the le arning a bility has m a ximum p otential to le arn fro m the S oul when the y are close. This y o g a is m ore im p ortant in D-10 or in D-2 4 than in R asi. 15. When a planet o wns 2 signs (M a in this case) it giv es the results of b oth houses, but giv es the results of the strong er house first. 16. B a dhakasthana - F or M o v a ble signs 11th house, Fix e d signs it is 9th house and for dual signs it is 7th house. F or Ar L A, R a is B a dhaka. B a dhaka giv es unse en troubles and is correlate d with pisacha or p e eta b a dhas. Since, R a in this chart is in L A, there are ine x plica ble troubles for the nativ e. The Bha d aka lord is calle d Bha d akesh. 17. G L – G atika or G ati L a gna – sho ws the e xistence fro m the p oint of vie w of p o w er.

In ord er to find that bho g a for this p erio d, w e count M D lord to A D lord and the sa m e num b er to the bho g a house – using this principle, the bho g a falls in Vi, the sa m e house as A S C, and this signifies a ne w b e ginning.

Q u e stio n: Why is N ativ e le arning Astrolo g y so seriously in the p ast y e ar? A n s wer: N ativ e is running Ju M D and R ahu A D. H e le arnt Astrolo g y so w ell that he rectifie d his o wn chart without ble mish. In Ju M D and R ahu A D the bho g a e x p erience d is the 8th house Ar. Fro m Ju, R ahu is in the 11th house (P aka) and fro m R ahu 11th house is Ar (Bho g a). 8th house is occult kno wle d g e – kno wle d g e of the hid d en. S a pta msa (D 7) N ativ e has tw o sons and one d aughter in the follo wing se quence - S on, S on and D aughter.

Dictu m: T o se e the o v erall ha p piness with Children one should locate the 5th lord of R asi(D1)t and se e ho w w ell the sa m e planet is place d in S a pta msa (D 7). Then one should also se e the place m ent of the 5th lord in S a pta msa itself (D 7) for m ale and 9th lord for a fe m ale. 2 7. F or N ativ e, Su is the 5th lord of R asi (D1) and he is in the trine in S a pta msa (D 7) and in a Mitra Sthana – this is a g o o d place m ent. 2 8. In S a pta msa (D 7) 5th lords are M a and K e – M a is e x alte d in the 7th and is w ell place d and this is g o o d place m ent. K e is with V e occupies the 12 house. Dictu m: In S a pta msa (D 7) 5th lord occup ying the 6th house or 6th lord in 5th house signify so m e kind of a pro ble m. The p erson m a y not ha v e children, or there might b e d ela y in ha ving children. 116 L esso ns o n V e dic Astrolo g y 2 9. In N ativ e’s case A S C is in C ancer, and this is an e v en sign. F or the first child w e g o b ack to the 5th house counting b ackw ard – Pi is the house. The lord is Ju and he is with S a. Dictu m: O d d signs are m ale and e v en signs are fe m ale. But the e xce ptions are G e-Cn e xchang e and A quarius-Pi e xchang e. 3 0. S a is a neuter and he can sho w either se x – b ecause of this one cannot b e 10 0 % sure that this is a m ale child. 31. Ju is in its house in Pi and this cle arly indicates m ale but with S a one cannot b e sure. Dictu m: D o not se e the R asi asp ects when d etermining the se x of the child. Dictu m: Ju with V e w ould usually indicate fe m ale but if this ha p p ens in Pi, V e w ould b e e x alte d and re present a m ale. If Ju w as with M o one w ould pre dict a fe m ale child but if this ha p p ens in T aurus, M o b eing e x alte d w ould re present a m ale. 3 2. In N ativ e’s case, Pi is a m ale sign, S a is a neuter but the tie bre aker is Ju. One should alw a ys lo ok at the house and the lord’s association to d etermine the se x of the child. 3 3. C ounting the third house b ackw ard fro m the first child, the second child w ould b e re presente d b y C p. The lord is S a and he is with Ju and this cle arly indicates a m ale child. S a is locate d in Pi which is a m ale sign. W e can confid ently pre dict a m ale child. 3 4. In N ativ e’s case, to g et to the ne xt child, counting 3rd house b ackw ards, one has to cross o v er R ahu and this usually indicates the end. H o w e v er, so m etim es one m a y ha v e one m ore child and then it ends. In N ativ e’s case when one jum ps o v er R ahu and g ets to Scorpio, Su, the 5th lord in R asi (D1) asp ecte d b y Ju se e ms to b e strong enough to m ake this ha p p en. But this is tough to pre dict. 3 5. F or d etermining the se x of the child, lords of Scorpio are M a and K e. One has to take the strong er b etw e en the m. Dictu m: The follo wing thre e principles usually bre ak the tie in d etermining the strong er of tw o planets. These principles ha v e to a p plie d is this se quence in ord er to d etermine the strong er of the tw o. a. The one with m ore planets b. The planet asp ecte d b y Ju, M e or disp ositor of that house b y R asi drishti c. Who e v er is e x alte d`,

`3 6. In N ativ e’s case - M a is with zero planets but K e is with V enus. K e is strong er. K e is with V e - fe m ale, and in G e a fe m ale sign. With confid ence one can pre dict a fe m ale child. 3 7. N ativ e’s d aughter’s A S C is G e. One w ould e x p ect that her chart ha v e a strong V enusian influence. N ativ e is not sure. It is V e who help e d K e b eco m e the lord and win o v er M a, it is only b ecause of V e that N ativ e ha d a fe m ale child. In such a case the influence of V e w ould b e v ery strong in the child’s chart. S a pta m asa (D 7) also p asse d the test. Drekkana (D 3): N ativ e did not lo ok at it much. 3 8. N ativ e has/ha d tw o eld er brothers, one eld er sister, one y oung er brother and tw o y oung er sisters. 3 9. N ativ e’s im m e diate y oung er sister die d. 4 0. B ecause the A S C is in L e and o d d sign, one counts forw ard. F or the ne xt im m e diate sibling w e take the 3rd house fro m L e and this is Li. The lord of the house is V e and V e is locate d in Scorpio. F or this sibling Scorpio w ould b e taken as A S C. 41. S e x of sibling cannot b e d etermine d in Drekkana(D 3) although in N ativ e’s case it se e ms to w ork. B y using the g eneral dictums one can d etermine that the im m e diate eld er is a m ale, the one eld er to that one is also a m ale, and the one eld er to that p erson is a fe m ale – M e with e x alte d M o is a m ale, M a is ne xt, S a is ne xt with V e is fe m ale. 4 2. N ativ e’s im m e diate y oung er sister die d when she w as tw o y e ars old. T aking Scorpio as A S C one can notice that all 3 planets Su, S a and M e are all in M K S. F or Scorpio A S C 8th lord M e is in 12th fro m the 8th house, i.e., 7th house. 8th house re presents long e vity and the lord b eing place d in the 12th fro m it sho ws alp a-a yush. Usually if 8th lord is in the 7th or if 7th lord is in 8th then it is not g o o d for long life. In a d dition, for M e 7th house is a M K S and this is p articularly b a d for long e vity. F or L e A S C, if Ju is in A q. It is b a d but, for this co m bination this is e v en w orse b ecause 8th lord M e is in the 7th house and in M K S. Dictu m: Whene v er a planet is in M K S in a chart, the house(s) it o wn(s) are affecte d tre m end ously. F or e x a m ple, if 4th lord is in M K S then that p erson m a y ha v e b a d relationship with m other or m other m a y die e arly. O v erall y ou can lo ok at the chart and sa y that so m ething b a d will ha p p en relating to those house m atters.

The ne xt sibling is a sister. The ne xt sibling is 3rd fro m Li, which is S g. L ord Ju is in Vi (Vi is a fe m ale sign). One has to Vi as A S C for this sibling. This sibling’s chart w as discusse d in an e arlier class. This sibling’s e x-sp ouse is a S oftw are Engine er. F or d etermining the sp ouse of this sibling, take the U p a p a d a (U L) fro m sister’s A S C. In this case this is sa m e as A L, which is S g. T aking S g as A S C, 10th fro m S g is Vi . The lord M ercury is in the 6th house T aurus with e x alte d M o on. A m ongst 2nd , 6th and 10th houses, 6th is the strong est that to o b eing the 10th lord. S o M ercury is the d eciding factor and naturally giv es a lo gical p erson like a S oftw are Engine er, M athe m atician, etc. S o, Drekkana(D 3) p asses the rectification test. Vimsa msa(D 2 0) 4 4. M o is the Atm a karaka and 5th lord occup ying A S C, i.e., Pi. Dictu m: If A K is in A S C in any a msa that m e ans g o d co m es to that p erson in that a msa. That is a gre at blessing. 4 5. In N ativ e’s case, in spiritual m atters he is v ery fortunate. 4 6. F or Sri P. V. R. N arasimha R a o, A K is in A S C in Sid dha m a (D 2 4) and le arning co m es to him v ery e asily. Dictu m: If Atm a karaka (A K) is in A S C in N a v a msa (D 9) one is usually a king according to P arasura. Essentially one is v ery blesse d with re g ards to Dharm a and will d o v ery g o o d karm a. 4 7. In N ativ e’s chart A S C lord Ju is in the 7th asp ecting A S C and M o is also the 5th lord of d e v otion. This is a brilliant M aha R aja y o g a – co m binations of A S C L ord, Ju, Atm a karaka (A K) and 5th lord M o in A S C. N ativ e must b e a v ery spiritual p erson. 4 8.

G ains fro m this m arria g e (11th house) are children thus, G e sho ws the first child. L ord of G e, M e is in Ar. L a gna of the child is Ar (M arsian) and/or M ercurian influence... A b o v e analysis is wrong, w e m a d e a big mistake. First child fro m 2nd m arria g e is giv en b y G e, and there w as an a b ortion - 8th L ords sa +ra are in G e, chance of pre gnancy lost is p ossible. If this p erson ca m e to y ou after m arria g e, y ou can tell the m to pro pitiate M e (L ord Vishnu), the first child w ould ha v e surviv e d. 6 4.

In this case L e lord Su is with V e (fe m ale planet) hence, its a girl. 6 5. Third fro m L e is Li, lord V e with Su (m ale planet), hence a b o y. A S C for 2nd child is in Li.

R a in 8th is v ery b a d. a. 8th is not a m alefic sign, it is a dusthana (neutral) sign. M a, S a, and R a are g o o d in 3, 6, 11 (only in P a a p a sthanas) and any other houses are b a d.

Discussion about utility of astrology and how it should be applied for remedial measures. Key Points: 1. Question: Does there have to be Ra/Ke in the 9H for foreign trip to happen during the period of the Narayana Dasa of the 9H sign? Ans: Not necessarily. The involvement of 9H or 12H and their lords with Ra/Ke is suffice. Ra is the karaka for the project of foreign travel. The house, say 9H, represents the project, the planet in the 9H represents the persons working in the project, the 9th lord is the manager of these persons. If the karaka (Ra) has sufficient control, or if the karaka is a good friend of the people-manager, then the project will be done successfully. This is true in Rasi and also in D-4. Puzzle Chart: 2. In D-10, 10H (Career) is empty. 10L Ve is weak being with enemy Ju, but forms Raja yoga as Ju is 5L. LL Su is in 5H (Abilities, Recognition). Overall, a successful person. 3. 6H has exalted Ma – service-type career likely. A10 (formal career) is in the 7H (desire) – business is also possible. But career is indicated by the strongest amongst the 2H, 6H and 10H. 10H is strongest being aspected by its lord Ve which is in`,

`R aja y o g a with Ju. V e is resp onsible for entertainm ent-ty p e care er. H ere is a similarity with Aishw ariy a R ai’s D-10 Chart. 4. The p erson who has 5 L (fa m e/follo wing) strong er than the 10 L (achie v e m ent) will ha v e a lot of fan-follo wing/a dulation much m ore in pro p ortion to his achie v e m ents. 5 L and 10 L conjoining is g o o d as it indicate d that there is a link b etw e en the tw o asp ects. 5. M a is g o o d in 3 H, 6 H and 11H. M a is e x alte d in 6 H. T o se e if this is g o o d, se e lordship. M a is 4 L (co mfort) and 9 L (fortune/dharm a) – therefore y o g akaraka. H ence e x altation is v ery g o o d. E x alte d 9 L in D-10 indicates lot of e asy luck, where as d e bilitate d 9 L sho ws lack of protection and ne e d to w ork hard for achie v e m ents. 6. Public Im a g e: K e in A L – he a dless/crazy or highly spiritual. A L in M artian sign – p ossibly a le a d er in his field or g o-g etter/d yna mic p erson. 7. Planets in trines to A L (M e & Su) will b o ost/protect the p erson’s im a g e during their d asas. V e/Ju conjunction is a g o o d raja y o g a asp ecting A L b y rasi-drishti, hence their effects will m anifest in b ettering the im a g e of the p erson. M ore than graha-drishti, rasidrishti is consid ere d for the p erm anent influences on A L. 8. In D-9, planets in trine to A S C (Su & Ju) indicate talents/a bilities. Su re presents rhythm/music and M o re presents m elo d y/singing. L L M o is e x alte d. Singing or musical a bility is pro minent. T o se e if he writes his o wn lyrics, se e if there is any V e-influence (song/p o e m/im a ginativ e writing) in the 3 H. M e-influence sho ws prose /scholarly writing. 9. This p erson is Micha el Jackson. H e is fighting litig ation at present. Fro m Tithi Pra v esha (2 0 0 4-2 0 0 5) Chart, will this p erson g o to jail during this p erio d? H ora L ord M a indicate d m ain e v ents of the y e ar. It is 5 L and 12 L place d with 9 L Su and 7 L M e in the 9 H (L e o) – protection. B andhana S aha m a m is at the end of C p; its lord S a d o esn’t ha v e a strong connection with the 12th L or H. 10. Fro m the Tithi Pra v esha (2 0 0 5-2 0 0 6) Chart, S a is H ora L ord, 6 L and 7 L in 12 H in p ariv artana with M o. R a is v ery close to B andhana S aha m a m in Pi in 8 H. Chances of im prisonm ent are there but are w e ak. 11. Fro m the Tithi Pra v esha (2 0 0 6-2 0 0 7) Chart, H ora L ord and L L M e is in 12 H with 12 L Su and V e (B andhana S aha m a m L ord). There is a strong connection for im prisonm ent. This is similar to S w a mi Ja y endra S arasw ati’s chart. H ere Su is likely to cause im prisonm ent. The ord er of m aleficence is V e < M e < Su. S o Su c a n (but d o esn’t ha v e to) e xchang e its results with V e. 12. In natal D-10 Chart, none of the conditional d asas are a p plica ble. Use Vimsottari D asa. Present M aha d asa lord is M e. M e is 5th fro m A L and hence enhances the im a g e. Planets in the 14 2 L esso ns o n V e dic Astrolo g y 5 H fro m A L giv e a b o ost to the im a g e and in the 9 H fro m A L protects/m aintains the im a g e. 13. In the R asi Chart, M e is in R aja y o g a (4 L and 5 L) with Su in the 4 H – Sri Vishnu’s blessings. N e xt M aha d asa is K e starting fro m F e b 2 8, 2 0 0 6. K e is a m alefic in the 12 H with its lord (M a) – likely to giv e im prisonm ent in K e d asa. 12 L alo n e in 12 H forms a g o o d y o g a, Vim ala Y o g a. But with other planets can cause pro ble ms like hug e e x p enses/hospitalization/im prisonm ent i.e. 12 H significance of so m e kind of giving-up of things im p ortant to the p erson. G L in 12 H sho ws the e v ent of im prisonm ent will b e fa m ous. K e in 12 H can also signify so m e spiritual d e v elo p m ent. This can b e v erifie d fro m D-2 0. 14. K e d asa runs till 2 013. Chances of g etting out of prison are v ery slim till the ne xt D asa which is V e. V e d asa is v ery pro mising for a ne w le ase of life/care er. V e is L L w ell place d in the 3 H. V e is also giving R aja y o g a in the D-10. N ara y ana D asa Analysis: 15. 3 B asic Principles of Analysis: a. 1st Principle: Jud g m ent b ase d on the activ ation of N ara y ana in the house of the d asa rasi b. 2nd Principle: L ocation of the Pro gresse d A S C and jud g m ent of the natal rasi chart fro m this Pro gresse d L A c. 3rd Principle: Jud g m ent of the antard asa fro m the Entry Chart. 16. R asi Chart: Present D asa is Cn in 3 H. N ara y ana (in C p) is activ ate d. V e is L L in Cn and sho ws e xistence/ he alth/ character/ wisd o m. 6 H sho ws enmity/ riv alry/ litig ation/ strug gle. 6 H has Guru-Chand ala-Y o g a (Ju/R a) and signifies trouble relating to that house. Ju-R a in 7 H – serious pro ble m in m arria g e; in 9 H – pro ble m/misfortune re g arding father; in 1H – p o or d e v elo p m ent of intellig ence/he alth etc. 17. Sup p ose for T a-L A, Su-M e-Ju-R a are in 1H. This is b etter than just Ju-R a there. When Ju (priest) is afflicte d with R a (wicke d p erson), pra y er to Su (king) is a d vise d; similarly when R a afflictes Su, pra y er to Ju is a d vise d. H ence Su-M e conjoining JuR a is b etter. Su-M e is also a R aja y o g a for this L A. 18. In the present case, D asa rasi in Cn with V e as L L and 6 L indicate so m e issues like litig ation, enmity and he alth will occur b y 1st Principle. F or 2nd Principle, Pro gresse d A S C is C p. Ju-R a is in the 10 H fro m this A S C – care er is ruine d. 6 L M e with 8 L Su in 8 H giv es a V R Y which is g o o d but only after giving so m e tensions. But M e is also 9 L in 8 H is not g o o d – lack/withdra w al of protection. O v erall, lot of frustration/anxiety/ unlucky p erio d. 4 H (co mfort/ m other/ e ducation/ v ehicles) is also afflicte d b y tw o m alefics (M a is son of Rudra, w ants to protect o wn house; K e is L esso n # 3 2 14 3 calle d Rudrasw arup a, w ants to d estro y) – so m e misfortune relate d to this house. K e is also lord of 8th fro m 4 H – d e pleting sukha. 19. Current antard asa is S g. In the P erio d entry chart of the Cn d asa, 12 L Ju afflicts L L S a. K e in S g in 12 H giv es d etachm ent or giving-up. N e xt antard asa in C p with its lord S a in trines to it – not much difficulty in this d asa. Pro ble ms will resurface in 2 0 0 6 p erio d pro b a bly after a p p e als etc. 2 0. Q u e stio n: Shall w e consid er b h o g a for this chart? Ans: N o. C onsid er b h o g a only for Vimsottari D asa syste m. 21. N e xt M aha d asa is L e o, ha ving a g o o d R aja y o g a Su-M e (lot of follo wing and sup p ort). N ara y ana is activ ating Su, M e, A 8 (Mrityup a d a, hardship) and L e o sign which is 4th (sense of right direction) fro m L a, and 12th fro m A L (fall in status). Pro gresse d A S C is A q. 9 H fro m it is d estro y e d. 7 L (loss of long e vity) and 8 L (giving long e vity) are to g ether in the 7 H with A 8 also joining – he alth trouble/d e ath likely (b efore August 2 017). N ote that N ara y ana D asa is not the b est d asa for se eing d e ath. 2 2. In D-2 0, lord of 5 H (d e v otion) is in the 8th fro m 5th – lack of d e v otion/discipline or trouble b eing d e v ote d. 9 L V e in 7 H – strong spiritual d esire. N o sp ecial y o g as in this chart. But, V e is 4 L and 9 L and L L S a is in V enus-sign. H ence, V e d asa will b e a v ery g o o d d asa. On a final note, this birth d ata is rectifie d for R asi. D-9 and D-10. D-2 0 hasn’t b e en rectifie d. 2 3. N ara y ana D asa of Divisional Charts, sa y D-10. F or D-10, controlling house is 10 H. In R asi Chart, 10 L is either S a or R a. N o w co m e to D-10 and find strong er of S a and R a. B y S ources of Strength rules, R a is strong er. R a is in Li; 7th fro m Li is Ar. B etw e en, Li and Ar, Ar is strong er. H ence, N ara y ana D asas of this chart start fro m Ar. As Ar is m o v a ble sign, Brahm a pro gression is use d. 9th fro m Ar is S g (o d d-fo ote d) so the pro gression should ha v e b e en in the forw ard direction. But b ecause of K e in Ar, it is b ackw ard. [If S a w ere present in Ar then the pro gression is alw a ys Brahm a-forw ard]. 2 4. F or Divisional N ara y ana D asa, only use the 1st principle.

`Topics Covered: 1. Three-parts-rule to judge Narayana Dasa of Rasi Chart 2. Example Chart 1: Guru P. V. R. Narasimha Rao, April 4, 1970, 5:47:13 p.m. (+5.5 hrs East of GMT), Machilipatnam, India (81E08, 16N10) Key Points: Example Chart 1 and explanation of Rule 1. Ar is the present Narayana Dasa of the Rasi Chart. Ar is in 8H. Hence, during this dasa, 8H results can be given. Lord of Ar is Ma which is 3L as well. Hence, during this dasa, 3H results can also be given. Lord of Ar is 8H, hence in this case 8H results (i.e. the result of the house containing the Dasa Lord) again may also be given. If there are planets, which are aspecting the Dasa rasi, they can also give their results during the period. Hence, several results are possible in Ar dasa itself. 2. Also for example, if Le is the running dasa, then 12H results can be given as Le is in the 12H. Additional results that are possible are: 10H (as Le is 10th from AL), 7H (as its Lord Su is in 7H), result of Ke, result of 3H (as 3L is Ke), results of Ju, Ve, Ma, Me and Sa (as they aspect Le by rasi drishti). Thus again a number of results can occur in Le dasa. There are clear rules to find out which result is experienced in which part of the dasa. 3. To prove the point further, Cn is the second dasa and is in the 11H. Hence during this dasa, there could have been gains. As 11L Mo is aspecting it by rasi drishti, there may be some gains related to food business or nursing business (Mo significations). Again, Mo is in the 6H of enmity and also afflicted by Ra. Hence some enmity may also be experienced. Whether the enmity is related to gains is a different issue, but the fact that there is a possibility of enmity is clear. Suppose, the 4 L or 7L Ju is placed in Cn, there could be gain related to 4H and 7H (home/car/wife etc) or relationship with the spouse may be harmonious (as Ju in Cn would be exalted). 4. Parasara defined some signs as Sirshodaya Rasis (Sirsha or head + udaya or rising), some as Prishtodaya Rasis and the rest as Ubhayodaya Rasis. Sirshodaya Prishtodaya Ubhayodaya Ge, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Aq Ar, Ta, Cn, Sg, Cp Pi L esso n # 3 3 14 7 5. Rule to Jud g e a N ara y ana D asa (also calle d Thre e-p arts-rule) : a. E ach M aha d asa is divid e d into thre e e qual p erio ds or slots. In one of these slots will giv e results of the sign, in another slot will giv e the results of the lord of the sign and the re m aining slot will giv e the results of the v arious associations of the sign (planets occup ying the d asa sign or asp ecting the sign b y ra si dris hti only). b. If D asa R asi is Sirsho d a y a, the result of the sign co m es in the first slot, in case of Prishto d a y a, the result of the sign co m es in the last slot and in case of the U bha y o d a y a the result co m es in the mid dle slot. c. If the lord of the D asa R asi occupies a Sirsho d a y a or U bha y o d a y a R asi, then the lord will giv e its result in the first a v aila ble slot after the Rule (b) is e x ecute d. If, ho w e v er, the D asa R asi L ord is in a Prishto d a y a R asi, it will giv e its result in the last a v aila ble slot. d. The re m aining results (results due to the association/asp ect to the D asa R asi) will b e giv en in the re m aining slot. F or e x a m ple, if the D asa R asi is Sirsho d a y a and its L ord is place d in a Sirsho d a y a R asi, then the se quence of results will b e: 1st Slot – results of the D asa R asi, 2nd Slot – results of the L ord of the D asa R asi, 3rd Slot – results of the conjunction/asp ects to the D asa R asi. e. C onsid er the slot which is to giv e the results of the v arious associations (conjunctions/asp ects) of the D asa R asi (se e “d”). Sup p ose there are ‘n’ num b er of planets (counting R a and K e if a p pro priate) that are asp ecting/conjoining the D asa R asi. Then divid e this slot into ‘n’ e qual p arts. E ach such p art will giv e result of one of the ‘n’ associating planets. F or e x a m ple, in the E x a m ple Chart 1, Ar is the present D asa R asi. Ar is Prishto d a y a R asi and its lord M a is occup ying Ar itself. H ence the se quence of results are 1st Slot – results of all associating planets (i.e. V e, S a, M a, M e, K e, M o, R a i.e. n = 7), 2nd Slot – results of M ars, 3rd Slot – results of Ar. Therefore, divid e the 1st Slot into 7 e qual p arts. B ecause the antard asas are e qual in length, e ach Slot consists of 4 antard asas. S o the first 4 antard asas i.e. A pril 19 9 5 through A pril 19 9 9 constitute the 1st Slot. R esults of M a will b e e x p erience d in the mid dle four antard asas or A pril 19 9 9 through A pril 2 0 0 3. The last 4 antard asas constitutes the 3rd Slot and giv es the results of Ar. The 1st Slot of 4 y e ars i.e. 4 8 m onths are to b e divid e d into 7 p arts, giving roughly 7 m onths as e ach p art. Out of the associating planets, the planet with the highest longitud e (in its occup ying sign) will take up the p art 1, the ne xt p arts b eing taken up b y planets 14 8 L esso ns o n V e dic Astrolo g y with d ecre asing v alue of longitud es. R efer to K arakatv as to se e why this sche m e is taken. F or R a and K e, (3 00 – longitud e d e gre es) are taken here, just like for d etermining the K arakatv a sche m e. If sup p ose M e takes up p art n (n b eing the num b er a m ong the planets), it m e ans that although through out the 1st Slot, there are so m e results relate d to M e in Ar, the p e ak of such results will occur in the p art “n” of the 1st Slot. f. The one-third Slot corresp onding to the L ord of the D asa R asi can b e sub divid e d into 4 e qual p arts or quarters. If the lord of the D asa R asi is a b enefic, the first quarter g o es to results of the lord’s occup ying sign, the second quarter g o es to results of the houses o wne d b y the planet, the third quarter g o es to the y o g as p articip ate d b y the planet, and the last quarter g o es to the state or a v astha of the planet. If the lord of the D asa R asi is a m alefic planet, then the ord er is re v erse. H ence, the first quarter g o es to a v astha, second quarter g o es to y o g as, third quarter g o es to houses it lords, and the last quarter g o es to the results of the occup ying house. N ote: (a) H ere only natural m alefic/b enefic nature is to b e consid ere d. M e is m alefic or b enefic d e p ending on its association with m alefic or b enefic planets. M o is b enefic if it is w a xing (sukla p aksha) and m alefic if it is w aning (Krishna p aksha). (b) If the entire M aha D asa p erio d is only one y e ar or so long, then sub-sub-division m a y not b e d one. In such cases, Tithi Pra v esha will giv e g o o d jud g m ent with p erha ps b etter precision. E x a m ple Chart 1 6. In this chart, the S g d asa ran fro m A pril 19 8 5 through A pril 19 9 5. S g is Prishto o d a y a R asi and its lord Ju is in Li, a Sirsho d a y a R asi. H ence, b y the Thre e-p arts-rule, 1st Slot g o es to Ju, 2nd Slot g o es to associating planets (here Su only) and 3rd Slot g o es to S g/4 H. E ach Slot consists of 4 antard asas. 7. Ju is b enefic. Therefore, a. first quarter of 1st Slot g o es to Li/2 H (e.g. w e alth or resources etc relating to e ducation/re al estate b ecause Ju is lord of the se e d sign S g/4 H – receiv e d national e ducational scholarship), b. second quarter g o es to S g/4 H and Pi/7 H (e.g. e ducation/m arria g e), c. third quarter g o es to its y o g as (e.g. Ju is in sa m asa ptaka i.e. “mutual se v enth” with M e, V e, S a, M a; M e, S a and V e are trine lords and Ju is lord of tw o kendras, thus giving se v eral L esso n # 3 3 14 9 R aja Y o g a; Ju-M a is a Guru M ang ala y o g a; if Ju is in 2 H or 5 H and asp ecte d b y M e or V e results in K alanidhi Y o g a) d. last quarter g o es to its a v astha (here Ju is retro gra d e – not g o o d; place d in an inimical sign Libra; V e is also Ju’s te m p orary ene m y as it is not place d within thre e signs fro m Ju; therefore the last quarter will giv e only a v era g e results). Whate v er natal chart pro mises, the d asa will only m o dify it and not co m pletely chang e it. 8. The mid dle one-third or 2nd Slot g o es to associating planets of S g. H ere only Su is asp ecting S g b y rasi drishti. Su has 4 y e ars to giv e its results. Using the sa m e rules as b efore, w e can further sub-divid e into four e qual p arts or quarters. Su is m alefic. H ence, a. first quarter g o es to a v asthas (here Su is in a Jupiterian sign but Ju is not place d within thre e sign-rang e fro m Su. H ence Su is m o d erately w ell place d. C onsid er thre e kinds of a v asthas b ase d on – a g e, alertness and m o o d. Giv e highest im p ortance to place m ent in friendly/neutral/inimical sign, the second ary im p ortance to uchha b ala/ne echa b ala, and tertiary im p ortance to sa y ana di a v asthas etc.) Su is the planet of authority. H ere Su asp ects the 4 H. H ence there is a p ossibility of attaining so m e authority/re putation in e ducational field through out this p erio d. In fact during this p erio d, the nativ e sto o d first in his class b y a hug e m argin. b. (ii) S econd quarter g o es to y o g as of Su. Su is subjecte d to p a p a-kartari y o g a. Also Su is subjecte d to Bhaskara Y o g a (fro m M o, Su in 2nd , M e in 3rd , Ju in 9th ) – w e althy, le arne d of sastras and astrolo g y. H ence, this p erio d also indicate d g o o d le arning. Su is also v ery closely afflicte d b y Gulika. When a m alefic planet is asp ecting the 4 H, there can b e loss of m ental p e ace. This w as a p erio d of b a d he alth for the nativ e. c. (iii) The third quarter g o es to the result of the house o wne d b y the Sun, here 12 H. This inv olv e d so m e sort of giving or giving up. The nativ e during this p erio d im p arte d kno wle d g e (te aching). 12 H is also for g oing a bro a d, esp ecially with K e in it.

(iv) The last quarter Su will giv e the results of the house he occupies. H ere it is 7H or B a dhakasthana (H ouse of O bstruction). 7 H and 9 H are houses to b e consid ere d for g oing a bro a d, 9 H is for flourishing a bro a d and 12 H is the house for settling a bro a d. A p art fro m these the B a dhakasthana is also an im p ortant house for g oing a bro a d. F or M o v a ble Signs (Ar, Cn, Li, C p) the B a dhakasthana is 15 0 L esso ns o n V e dic Astrolo g y 11H, fro m Fix e d Signs (T a, L e, Sc, A q) it is 9 H and for Dual Signs (G e, Vi, S g, Pi) it is 7 H.

First one-third of the M aha d asa or (1st Slot as w e ha v e b e en calling it) is taken up b y associations of Ar (na m ely 7 planets that are conjoining or asp ecting it b y rasi-drishti). The ne xt one-third or 2nd Slot will giv e results of the lord M a. The last Slot will take up results of the sign itself. 11. The first slot is divid e d into 7 e qual p arts or a b out (4 8 divid e d b y 7 = )7 m onths e ach. The will b e taken up in chronolo gical ord er b y M o, M a, S a, R a, K e, V e and M e. N ote than R a prece d es K e. This is b ase d on a tra ditional vie w p oint. Another vie w p oint is to consid er the relativ e strengths of R a and K e (b ase d on occup ying signs and associations the y ha v e) and cho ose the ord er b etw e en R a and K e. E ach of these 7 planets will bring in their im p acts on the Ar sign. R esults: M o – The11L place d in 6 H and asp ects Ar/8 H. Therefore, M o is bringing the 11H results to 8 H through 6 H – i.e. bringing so m e kind of g ains to the 8 H b y o v erco ming of o bstacles or through service. The nativ e w ent to K ore a for a fe w m onths on service and then d ecid e d to co m e b ack to the U S and after changing a couple of jo bs, found a suita ble one. M a – 8 L is in o wn house, hence a v ery g o o d p erio d. B eing 8 H (chang es) there w ere certain chang es (g etting visa to U S etc) for the g o o d.

M a is strong in Ar as it is its M o olatrikona. M a is also in Nrity alipsa a v astha – v ery energ etic. H ence the results will b e g o o d p articularly in the 8 H m atters like occult le arning and M artian m atters. b. S econd quarter p ertains to results for M a-y o g as. There are Vip are eta R aja Y o g a with S a, tw o R ajasa m b andha Y o g as (A m K conjoining 10 L and A m K in o wn sign) – things w ent w ell in the care er and the nativ e receiv e d reco gnition at his w ork place, Guru-M ang ala Y o g a, V esi Y o g a etc. In fact, M a is in y o g a with all the planets e xce pt M o and the N o d es. There are also ne g ativ e y o g as also; M a is a m alefic planet and is afflicting the trinal lords. T o se e this effect note ho w close these trinal lords are.

M ore o v er if B a dhaka L ord (here Ju) associate d with 8 L or 9 L, the p erson can settle a bro a d. During this p erio d the nativ e receiv e d Gre en C ard. c. Third quarter g o es to house lord e d b y M a. M a is 3 L and 8 L. 3 H is 12 H fro m 4 H; hence 3 H can sho w a big inv estm ent (i.e. e x p enses) for the 4 H (v ehicle/house) etc. M a is also the karaka for this significance. 3 L and 8 L place d in a dusthana sho ws g o o d results corresp onding to these houses. There w ere chang es in the jo b and insta bilities in g eneral and the nativ e m o v e d into a ne w house. d. L ast quarter g o es to the house M a occupies. H ere M a occupies 8 H. This is thus the p erio d when the results of M a b eing in 8 H co m e. F or the tim e b eing, forg et that M a is in 15 2 L esso ns o n V e dic Astrolo g y o wn house. H ence this p erio d w as pro ble m atic. Further M a is A m K in the 8 H – b a d for care er. The interesting thing is that all the other sub-p erio ds w ere g o o d o v erall, but only during this quarter the b a d results occurre d. The nativ e lost his jo b and ha d to settle for w orking fro m ho m e for another jo b that w as not sta ble. 13. The last one-third is for Ar. It is a m alefic sign, which is 3rd fro m A L. W e kno w that a m alefic planet in the 3rd or 6th fro m A L is g o o d where as a b enefic there is not g o o d (m aterially sp e aking). Similarly, is a m alefic sign is 3rd or 6th fro m the A L it is g o o d where as a b enefic sign there is b a d (i.e. m aterial losses). H ence Ar b eing in the 3rd fro m A L is g o o d. Ar is 8th fro m L a and hence it is g o o d for occult studies but b a d for he alth. Fro m M o (mind), Ar is 3rd , sho wing lot of m ental energ y at this p erio d. Also, 6 H/A q asp ects Ar – fight, 3 H/Sc asp ecting – co m munication, 12 H/L e asp ecting – giving up and losses. 14.

Exaltation and Debilitation of Planets Based on Moon Sign

Every planet has a positive and negative placement. For instance, a well-placed planet, or an exalted planet can lead you to great achievements in life. At the same time, a debilitated planet in a weak position can cause you to go through a rough and challenging phase.

 Exalted Planets signify strength and happiness by being placed in that friendly zodiac sign, like when you are at your home and there’s something special about that one corner, which attracts you always to spend your time there. You also get new innovative ide as while the spark of creativity will ignite your mind when resting in that corner",

The tough time in your life: Debilitation of Planets Due to your busy schedule, you were not able to clean your garden and the room that got messed because of the last party night. Now, you are struggling while cleaning that alone and are exhausted with the burden of work related to that room or the corner. All these scenarios will be faced by planets as well, where the planet gets placed in such a zodiac sign, that it gets tired and loses its strength. This form of placements is known as debilitation in Vedic Astrology.

If you have debilitated Planets in your birth chart, you will face struggles related to the significance of those Planets.

Sun (Surya): The Celestial KingAdd commentMore actions

It is said that the Sun is the soul of the planets. It is vital, respectable, authoritative, and has many other great attributes. Sun will demonstrate how an individual reflects themselves onto the world.

Astrologically speaking, a strong Sun denotes authority and vitality, but a weak Sun can indicate egotism and a lack of self-assurance. When it involves your professional life, you might require a powerful Sun, but not when it relates to your personal connections.

It symbolizes

the Kshatriya caste,

the vice planet,

the Sattva guna,

the Pitta nature,

and the fire component.

According to astrology, the Sun governs the

head,

bones,

eyes,

heart,

and brain.

2. Moon (Chandra): The Nurturer

In the navagraha, the Moon stands for our psyche. It is recognised for having a maternal influence on people and for granting feelings of love, happiness, and positivity. Since the Moon represents the self in a kundli, its strength will benefit you at every stage of life.

However, mental health issues like

stress,

depression,

disinterest, etc,

can be brought on by a weak Moon.

Astrologically, the Moon is a member of the Vaisya (business-class) caste. It symbolizes

ladies,

Vata-Kapha nature and

sattva Guna.

You must wear white more often if the Moon is weak in your kundli. According to astrology, the Moon governs the

mind,

mother,

art,

vision,

saliva,

lungs,

silver,

rice,

and the chest.

The second house is all about communication, family, and resources, among other things. The second house also represents our ethics or the kind of job we do. If you have evil planets in your second homes, such as Rahu or Saturn, you will do work that is not permissible in society. However, if you have Planets such as Jupiter or Venus, you cannot do such practice jobs unless you are incapable of doing so. It will illustrate your family’s support of your practice, as well as the people who support your work.

Courage, short trip, change, and so on are all associated with the third house. The third house is associated with job transfers, job changes, and travel.

The 7th house represents the house of business. If your 7th house is high in your D10 chart or is linked to the 10th Lord, it will lead you to market. A solid 7th house in a D10 chart will bring business, while a solid 6th house will bring a Job. Often individuals are seen coming into business after leaving their employment. Their 6th and 7th houses are both substantial. The seventh house is the fourth house from the fourth. If you have benefic planets in your 7th family, it is fantastic for your prestige at work, travel, and so on.

The eighth house is the most mysterious. The 8th house is the house with Surprises, Delays, Obstacles, and other Negative Stuff.

So, these are the outcomes of the 10th Lord’s placing in the 12th house. We can also look at the D1 map, which has planets in the 10th house. The worlds with the most sway will represent the occupation. In certain instances, I also support Jaimini. Amatyakaraka is the giant planet for a career in Jaimini astrology. The Amatyakaraka planet’s position in the D10 map should also be observed. The sign and earth must be examined. The Dash you’re going through is also significant.

Planets that are important in determining a career in astrology The ruling and placement in the 10th house are relevant indicators for choosing the correct occupation. Though the tenth house is the most important for deciding a future career, it is not the only important house for determining a profession.

The Navamsa occupied by the 10th Lord plays a significant part. In addition to the 10th building, the 2nd, 11th, and 9th houses should be considered. When researching the native’s occupation, these houses are not to be overlooked.

If the outcomes of the more potent planets are intelligently blended, it will expose the most appropriate career. As a result, we recommend that the ascendant test the 10th, 2nd, 11th, and 9th houses.

The study of your Dasamsa chart’s various houses will help you get a clear view of your occupation and profession. The following is a summary of each house in the D10 chart:

First House: It is related to the renown you may obtain as a result of your work. Second House: It is concerned with investment and the origins of investment. Third House: It is all about making deals and communicating.

The fourth house indicates your office property and company properties. Fifth House: It is associated with company growth and the hiring of new workers. Sixth Home: This is the house of rivalry, chance, and relationships with coworkers.

The ninth house: It represents the possibility of corporate and professional travel. The tenth house is the most critical because it represents your earning ability and managerial abilities. Eleventh Home: This is the house of professional gains and associates.

The Twelfth House represents your hidden foes. In your company and profession, it is the house of loss.

How D10 Chart Prediction Helps While considering Career Astrology, we must consider the house and house-lord who have an impact on the 10th house of occupation. It is a fundamental assumption that the Lord of the house, who represents the tasks or function associated with a particular profession, would play a prominent role.

The 6th house and its Lord should also control the profession of police officers since the 6th house controls disorder, robbers, plague, loan, and lawsuits, among other things. Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter are the primary and secondary astrologers for police work.

Similarly, in addition to the 10th and other chambers, the 5th house should be studied for legal professions because the career of advocates and judges needs vital argumentative skill and brain application. The 5th house and its owner would influence diplomacy, imagination, coercion, and other such occupations.

The 8th house is concerned because having influence over many individuals or tasks is part of the role. The 8th house and its Lord are significant in the horoscopes of IAS, architects, MBAs, politicians, and others.

If service is indicated, the 6th house must influence the native’s occupation. If government service is mentioned, the influence of either the Sun or Moon on the 6th house or its Lord will almost definitely be present. The 10th lord, for example, may occupy the 6th house in Cancer or Leo, or the 6th lord may be put in the 10th house and receive the Navamsa, or constellation, of the Sun or Moon.

Before declaring the ultimate result of every part of life, the Navamsa chart must be considered. It is a great injustice to the native if the navamsa map is not given due consideration. Lords of the 10th, 2nd, and 11th houses in the Navamsa would be very helpful in determining your occupation. You will read more about using the Navamsa or D9 map in our detailed article.

Aside from Navamsa, the constellations are significant in every research to decide how to know a career. Each of the 27 constellations has its meaning. In comparison, the Atmakaraka and Amatyakaraka planets are very helpful in determining one’s occupation. Both of these elements should be intelligently combined. These are the celestial indicators for a person’s profession, employment, or trade.
