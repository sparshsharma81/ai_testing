🌙 1. Basic Concepts of Vedic Astrology

Vedic astrology uses 12 houses, 9 planets, and 12 zodiac signs to interpret a person’s life.

Birth chart (D1 / Lagna Chart) shows the physical world events—career, marriage, personality, health.

Ascendant (Lagna) determines mentality, physical traits, and major life direction.

Each house represents different life themes:

1st house – self, body, personality

2nd house – wealth, family

3rd house – courage, communication

4th house – home, mother

5th house – education, creativity

6th house – enemies, illness

7th house – marriage, partnerships

8th house – transformation, secrets

9th house – luck, dharma

10th house – career, reputation

11th house – gains, social circle

12th house – losses, foreign land
